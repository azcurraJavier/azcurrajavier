## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Javier, a Senior Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience.
In 2019, I relocated to London, UK, where I developed a strong passion for the dynamic and rapidly evolving field of Financial Technology.

I am currently working as a full-time Engineering Team Lead at [Yapily](https://www.yapily.com/) leading a talented team to drive innovation and technical excellence.

Please feel free to review my [resume](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Ps2rmMgoZcxqFCXG0QHPvfm17_uc2qXB) for a detailed overview of my professional journey and accomplishments.

Looking forward to connecting with you! 

Have a great day!
